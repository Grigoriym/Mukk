# Mukk

A desktop music player for Linux built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Desktop.

Mukk uses file-system-based browsing — an AIMP-style folder tree with a track list, rather than a flat database-driven library. Browse your music collection by folders, view track metadata, and play audio with GStreamer.
